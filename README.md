## Computational-physics-in-C
This repository contains the codes for a graduate-level computational physics course where I used numerical recipes in C to numerically solve different problems in physics as described below.

### Problems included in this repository:

1. Fractal-dimension -- Show the non-linear and self-similar behavior of the Duffing oscillator and diffusion-limited aggregation and find the fractal dimension in each case.
2.
