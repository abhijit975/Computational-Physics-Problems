## Computational-physics-in-C
This repository contains the codes for a graduate-level computational physics course where I used numerical recipes in C to numerically solve different problems in physics as described below. Theories are from the book Computational Physics by Thijssen.

### Problems included in this repository:

1. Fractal-dimension -- Show the non-linear and self-similar behavior of the Duffing oscillator and diffusion-limited aggregation and find the fractal dimension in each case.
2. Scattering-cross-section -- Generate a plot showing the total cross-section as a function of the energy for a Lennardâ€“Jones potential describing the H-Kr system.
3. Eigensolver -- Use the Cholskey decomposition to solve a linear system of equations and solve the eigenvalue equation of a Hamiltonian.
4. Helium-ground-state -- Calculate the ground state of the Helium atom using the Hartree-Fock method.
5. DFT-Hydrogen-atom -- Use density functional theory to find the radial wave function of the Hydrogen atom.
6. Verlet-Molecular-Dynamics -- Molecular dynamics simulation using the velocity-Verlet algorithm.
7. 2D-Ising -- Monte Carlo simulation of a 2D Ising model of size 40x40 with Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to show phase transition.
